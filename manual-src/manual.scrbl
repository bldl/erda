@title{Erda}

@author["Tero Hasu"]

@ErdaRkt, @ErdaRktAssign, and @ErdaCxx constitute a family of small programming languages and implementations for experimenting with error handling mechanisms. We use the unqualified name @deftech{Erda} to refer to the language family as a whole, or any one member of the family where the languages are all alike in relevant respects.

The ``concrete'' syntax of Erda resembles that of Racket (and Scheme).

@section{Example Code}

For sample @ErdaRkt code, see the @filepath{i1-prog.rkt} file of the Erda implementation codebase. Said code should evaluate as is within the Racket VM; see the @exec{racket} command of your Racket installation.

For sample @ErdaCxx programs, see the @filepath{test-*.rkt} files and @filepath{program-*} projects in the @filepath{tests} directory of the codebase.

Most of the provided sample @ErdaCxx programs will evaluate as is within the Racket VM. To instead translate said programs into C++, see the Magnolisp documentation, or look at the @filepath{Makefile}s in the @filepath{program-*} directories for example invocations of the @exec{mglc} command-line tool.

To run basic tests to verify that the Magnolisp compiler is available and working, you may run:
@commandline{make test}

@section{Source Code}

A Git repository of the Erda source code can be found at:

@section[#:tag "install"]{Installation}

The pre-requisites for installing the software are:
@itemlist[

 @item{@bold{Racket.} The primary implementation language of Erda. Version 6 (or higher) of Racket is required; a known-compatible version is 6.2.1, but versions 6.1--6.2.1 are all expected to work.}

 @item{@bold{Magnolisp.} A language and compiler serving as a basis for the implementation of @|ErdaCxx|. A known-compatible revision of Magnolisp is @|MAGNOLISPGITREV|.}

]

The software and the documentation can be built from source, or installed using the Racket package manager.
Racket is required for building and installation.

Once Racket and its tools have been installed, the Magnolisp and Erda packages can be installed with the @exec{raco} commands:
@nested[#:style 'inset]{
@verbatim{
raco pkg install git://github.com/bldl/magnolisp#@|short-MAGNOLISPGITREV|
raco pkg install git://github.com/bldl/erda
}}

The above commands should install the library, the command-line tool(s), and a HTML version of the manual.
