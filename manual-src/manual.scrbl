@title{Erda}

@author["Tero Hasu"]

@ErdaRkt, @ErdaRktAssign, and @ErdaCxx constitute a family of small programming languages and implementations for experimenting with error handling mechanisms. We use the unqualified name @deftech{Erda} to refer to the language family as a whole, or any one member of the family where the languages are all alike in relevant respects.

The ``concrete'' syntax of Erda resembles that of Racket (and Scheme).

@section{Example Code}

For sample @ErdaRkt code, see the @filepath{i1-prog.rkt} file of the Erda implementation codebase. Said code should evaluate as is within the Racket VM; see the @exec{racket} command of your Racket installation.

For sample @ErdaCxx programs, see the @filepath{test-*.rkt} files and @filepath{program-*} projects in the @filepath{tests} directory of the codebase.

Most of the provided sample @ErdaCxx programs will evaluate as is within the Racket VM. To instead translate said programs into C++, see the Magnolisp documentation, or look at the @filepath{Makefile}s in the @filepath{program-*} directories for example invocations of the @exec{mglc} command-line tool.

To run basic tests to verify that the Magnolisp compiler is available and working, you may run:
@commandline{make test}
